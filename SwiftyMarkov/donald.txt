If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names! 
We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it! 
Thank you Alabama! From now on, it’s going to be #AmericaFirst. Our goal is to bring back that wonderful phrase:… https://t.co/4UAazd7TmF 
China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.

Well, we all did it, together! I hope the "MOVEMENT" fans will go to D.C. on Jan 20th for the swearing in. Let's set the all time record! 
Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?

If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost? 
The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't! 
Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me "Person of the Year" - a great honor! 
Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!

The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments. 
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes! 
I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State. 
I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! 
Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. 
Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... 
I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning. 
The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!

The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. 
Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election? 
Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory! 
Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point. Just can't get much worse, although @CNN is right up there! 
Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy! 
Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned! 
I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U.S.Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON! 
Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic. There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium. A wonderful experience, and congrats to Army! 
I will be interviewed today on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:00 (Eastern) Network. ENJOY! 
October 2015 - thanks Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday! https://t.co/VEsgPcWq7z 
A very interesting read. Unfortunately, so much is true. https://t.co/ER2BoM765M 
Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS! 
As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun! 
I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME! 
.@RudyGiuliani, one of the finest people I know and a former GREAT Mayor of N.Y.C., just took himself out of consideration for "State".

Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn. He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers. He will be missed. 
If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time working-less time talking. Reduce dues 
Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!
